            Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other
            ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes
            were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of
            preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share
            features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards,
            and pies.

          The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The
          term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which
          means 'work'. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first
          known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states
          that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen and
          earlier from Old French travailler . In English, people still
          occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. According to
          Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales, the words
          travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman
          instrument of torture called the tripalium. This link may reflect the
          extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times
          may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination. Travel
          to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and
          adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also
          be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus,
          cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.
